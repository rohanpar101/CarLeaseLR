# CarLeaseLR
This is a very simple logistical regression program that does the following things: 
- Loads and scales the dataset, preparing it for modeling.
- Splits the data into training and testing sets.
- Trains a logistic regression model to predict whether someone leases a car based on their given information.
- Evaluates performance of the model using precision, recall, confusion matrix, and a precision-recall threshold plot.
- Analyzes model coefficients/odds to see which variables are of the most importance.

I wrote this due to the fact that I had done very similar work in the past, but because the data was confidential, it was not a public repository.
